👋 Hi, I’m Anna (@annalinhvu), currently working as a Senior BI Engineer and pursuing a master degree at UPenn part-time. I also graduated from Vanderbilt with a bachelor's degree in Economics.

👀 I’m passionate about all things data—engineering, manipulation, optimization, and visualization. With a foundation in SQL, Python, Tableau, and ETL processes, I’m now diving into Java to deepen my technical skills. I also have extensive experience in marketing analytics and consumer insights.

🌱 I'm always eager to learn and grow, whether it’s optimizing data workflows, exploring new technologies, or finding creative ways to turn data into meaningful insights.

💞️ I’d love to collaborate on projects related to data automation, visualization, and analytics. Beyond data, I enjoy photography, films, volunteering, and giving back to my community.

📫 Let’s connect! You can reach me via LinkedIn or at linh.h.vu@vanderbilt.edu.
